Starting query not attacker(m[])
goal reachable: attacker(m[])

Derivation:

1. The attacker has some term y.
attacker(y).

2. By 1, the attacker may know y.
Using the function pk the attacker may obtain pk(y).
attacker(pk(y)).

3. The message pk(y) that the attacker may have by 2 may be received at input {6}.
So the message encrypt(m[],pk(y)) may be sent to the attacker at output {8}.
attacker(encrypt(m[],pk(y))).

4. By 3, the attacker may know encrypt(m[],pk(y)).
By 1, the attacker may know y.
Using the function decrypt the attacker may obtain m[].
attacker(m[]).

5. By 4, attacker(m[]).
The goal is reached, represented in the following fact:
attacker(m[]).


A more detailed output of the traces is available with
  set traceDisplay = long.

new wsk: skey creating wsk_1 at {1}

out(c, ~M) with ~M = pk(wsk_1) at {3}

in(c, pk(a)) at {6}

out(c, ~M_1) with ~M_1 = encrypt(m,pk(a)) at {8}

The attacker has the message decrypt(~M_1,a) = m.
A trace has been found.
RESULT not attacker(m[]) is false.
