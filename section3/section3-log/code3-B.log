Derivation:

1. The message 3 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],3).

2. The message 3 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 1 may be received at input {6}.
We have 2 ≠ 0.
So the message 2 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],2).

3. The message 3 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],3).

4. The message 3 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 3 may be received at input {6}.
We have 2 ≠ 0.
So the message 2 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],2).

5. The message 3 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],3).

6. The message 3 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 5 may be received at input {6}.
We have 2 ≠ 0.
So the message 2 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],2).

7. The message 2 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 6 may be received at input {6}.
We have 1 ≠ 0.
So the message 1 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],1).

8. The message 1 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 7 may be received at input {6}.
So the message (1,hash(seed[])) may be sent on channel u2[] at output {16}.
mess(u2[],(1,hash(seed[]))).

9. The message 2 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 4 may be received at input {6}.
The message (1,hash(seed[])) that may be sent on channel u2[] by 8 may be received at input {10}.
We have 1 ≠ 0.
So the message (1,hash(hash(seed[]))) may be sent on channel u2[] at output {13}.
mess(u2[],(1,hash(hash(seed[])))).

10. The message 2 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 2 may be received at input {6}.
The message (1,hash(hash(seed[]))) that may be sent on channel u2[] by 9 may be received at input {10}.
We have 1 ≠ 0.
So event COL may be executed at {15}.
event(COL).

11. By 10, event(COL).
The goal is reached, represented in the following fact:
event(COL).
