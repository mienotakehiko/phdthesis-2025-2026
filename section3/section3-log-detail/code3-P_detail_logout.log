Derivation:

1. The message sk[] may be sent to the attacker at output {5}.
attacker(sk[]).

2. The message enc(Ch[],sk[]) may be sent to the attacker at output {4}.
attacker(enc(Ch[],sk[])).

3. By 2, the attacker may know enc(Ch[],sk[]).
By 1, the attacker may know sk[].
Using the function dec the attacker may obtain Ch[].
attacker(Ch[]).

4. The message Document1[] may be sent on channel Ch[] at output {2}.
mess(Ch[],Document1[]).

5. By 3, the attacker may have the channel Ch[].
By 4, the message Document1[] may be sent on this channel.
So the attacker may obtain the message Document1[] by listening on this channel.

6. By 5, attacker(Document1[]).
The goal is reached, represented in the following fact:
attacker(Document1[]).


Could not find a trace corresponding to this derivation.
