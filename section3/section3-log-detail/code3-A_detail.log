Derivation:

1. The message 4 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],4).

2. The message 4 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],4).

3. The message 4 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 2 may be received at input {6}.
We have 3 ≠ 0.
So the message 3 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],3).

4. The message 4 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],4).

5. The message 4 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 4 may be received at input {6}.
We have 3 ≠ 0.
So the message 3 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],3).

6. The message 3 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 5 may be received at input {6}.
We have 2 ≠ 0.
So the message 2 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],2).

7. The message 4 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {3}.
mess(u1[],4).

8. The message 4 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 7 may be received at input {6}.
We have 3 ≠ 0.
So the message 3 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],3).

9. The message 3 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 8 may be received at input {6}.
We have 2 ≠ 0.
So the message 2 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],2).

10. The message 2 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 9 may be received at input {6}.
We have 1 ≠ 0.
So the message 1 may be sent on channel u1[] at output {9}.
mess(u1[],1).

11. The message 1 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 10 may be received at input {6}.
So the message (1,hash(seed[])) may be sent on channel u2[] at output {16}.
mess(u2[],(1,hash(seed[]))).

12. The message 2 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 6 may be received at input {6}.
The message (1,hash(seed[])) that may be sent on channel u2[] by 11 may be received at input {10}.
We have 1 ≠ 0.
So the message (2,hash(hash(seed[]))) may be sent on channel u2[] at output {13}.
mess(u2[],(2,hash(hash(seed[])))).

13. The message 3 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 3 may be received at input {6}.
The message (2,hash(hash(seed[]))) that may be sent on channel u2[] by 12 may be received at input {10}.
We have 2 ≠ 0.
So the message (3,hash(hash(hash(seed[])))) may be sent on channel u2[] at output {13}.
mess(u2[],(3,hash(hash(hash(seed[]))))).

14. The message 4 that may be sent on channel u1[] by 1 may be received at input {6}.
The message (3,hash(hash(hash(seed[])))) that may be sent on channel u2[] by 13 may be received at input {10}.
We have 3 ≠ 0.
So event COL may be executed at {15}.
event(COL).

15. By 14, event(COL).
The goal is reached, represented in the following fact:
event(COL).
